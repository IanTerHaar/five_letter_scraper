# Five-Letter Word Extractor

This Java program reads a text file containing 466,551 words, 
each on a new line, and extracts words based on their length 
without any punctuation. The extracted words are then written 
to a new text file.

This program's outputs will be used to make a game similar to 
the New York Times' game "Wordle."

The input word file is sourced from the 
[dwyl/english-words repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/tree/master).
