# Five-Letter Word Extractor

This Java program reads a text file containing 466,551 words, each on a new line, and extracts the words that are exactly 5 letters long without any punctuation. The extracted words are then written to a new text file.

The input word file is sourced from the [dwyl/english-words repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/tree/master).
